## Data Cleanup & Analysis

* Stared with extraction the data and loaded them into the jupyter to clean the CSV files. There are 2 sets of csv files in the database folder on Players, Nba_wins, and Season_stats the tiles with '"c" infront of them are the cleaned CSV files. Second step was gathering the data from the sources Our team  project's data was pulled from the recommend sites to use as sources of data: Kaggle

* Our team did a through transformation needed for these data sets by cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating the data.  - the data additional source links and reference can be found in the Final project report under project proposal tab.

## Team Effort

Lastly and probably the most important factor of this project was the team effort! and that was exceptional. We completed this project by going step by step Extracting, transforming, and loading of the data. keeping each others in loop while the double checking each othets work for the possible errors and requirements. For a successful group project all members in the group played a key role in in aligning project requirements and getting each other involved. That is what this team has done this ETL project.
